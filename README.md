# NuTalk

The project was about developping a application for older people to be able to get access to definitions of hip and trendy words.

The idea is that using Nuances speech to text we could record the audio of the user and then send it to our next apoi being the dictionary
API from urban dictionnary. The next step would be to then use the text to speech in order to speak the definition to the user.

We got the recording to work and the stop recording in order to recieve the stream of data. The next step was to the send that data to the
API by calling our own API built in node. That would then give us the text that we needed. The API calls to the Nuance TTS and ASR we're 
working formidably, unfortunatly we ran out of time in order to implement it all and this is what we are left with.
